# Conditions

Here we will talk about conditions

## What are conditions?

The sections which we talked about previously can be related with some special case when the section should be rendered. We are calling it condition here.

## How to implement Conditions?

When you first open the website you are greeted with 2 inputs i.e Title and Description of the form. After that insert questions inside the first `section` given to you.

:::caution

You can only add conditions on these type of questions

- Multiple Choice
- Dropdown
- Dropdown

:::

Now its time to create a new `Section` and add conditions.

1. Click on `Add Section`
2. Fill the title and description of the new section (OPTIONAL)
3. Click on the `Add Condition` dropdown.
4. Now you will see all your questions you have specified on the parent section(s).
5. Select the question and select the option(s). This implies that if the user have the exact same answers to the specified question then only the section we are about to create will be rendered.
6. Click on `Create`

Thats it now you have a new section with a specified condition.

:::tip

If you just want to make another section without specifying any condition just select `NONE` from the `Add Condition` dropdown.
